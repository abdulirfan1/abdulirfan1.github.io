            <p>This website is intentionally designed to demonstrate poor design principles. It features a chaotic layout, flashing elements, and excessive colors, making it an overwhelming experience for the user.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Lacks balance with overly bright colors and distracting visuals that make text hard to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Minimal repetition, leading to a scattered look that lacks unity.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Poor alignment, with elements appearing randomly placed, making it difficult to navigate.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Items are not logically grouped, creating a confusing experience for users trying to locate content.</li>
            </ul>
