            <p>ArkeType Apparel &amp; Co., founded by Muhammad Irfan in 2016, began as a modest venture offering a collection of blank t-shirts. Since its inception, the brand has evolved into a leading name in urban wear, committed to delivering high-quality clothing at an affordable price. ArkeType's product line spans from t-shirts and hoodies to a wide variety of casual wear, but their true expertise lies in premium denim.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Irfan expanded his vision by partnering with Salman and Noman Siddique, a move that marked a new chapter of growth for the company. Together, the trio has propelled ArkeType Apparel &amp; Co. forward, building a brand synonymous with style, quality, and innovation in urban fashion.</p>
