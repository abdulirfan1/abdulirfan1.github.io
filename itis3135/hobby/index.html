        <h2>About F1</h2>
        <p>Formula 1 (F1) is the premier international motorsport competition, featuring high-speed, open-wheel, single-seater race cars. Founded in 1950, it consists of a series of races known as Grand Prix, held on circuits around the world. F1 is renowned for its blend of cutting-edge technology, team strategy, and driver skill, with teams like Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull Racing competing for top honors. Each season, drivers and constructors vie for the championship titles, making F1 a thrilling showcase of engineering innovation, speed, and international fanfare.</p>

    <section id="f1-basics" class="section">
        <h2>Formula 1 Overview</h2>

        <h3>1. Teams and Drivers</h3>
        <p>Each team fields two cars with two drivers, competing independently but also contributing to the team's overall points. Teams are backed by major automotive manufacturers or racing specialists, such as Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull Racing.</p>

        <h3>2. Cars and Regulations</h3>
        <p>F1 cars are highly engineered, aerodynamic machines capable of speeds over 200 mph, with strict regulations on design, weight, and materials to ensure safety and fair competition. Teams spend millions on car development, balancing performance with fuel and tire management while meeting technical restrictions set by the FIA (the sport's governing body).</p>

        <h3>3. Race Weekend Format</h3>
        <p>Each race weekend includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Practice Sessions</strong> (Friday/Saturday): Three sessions where drivers test car setups and strategies.</li>
            <li><strong>Qualifying</strong> (Saturday): Divided into three rounds (Q1, Q2, Q3). This determines the starting grid order for the race based on lap times, with the fastest driver starting from pole position.</li>
            <li><strong>Race</strong> (Sunday): The main event where drivers compete to complete the set number of laps first, with points awarded based on finishing position.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Scoring System</h3>
        <p>Points are awarded to the top 10 finishers in each race, with 25 points for the winner, 18 for second place, and so on down to 1 point for 10th place. The fastest lap in the race, if achieved by a top-10 finisher, also grants an extra point. Points contribute to both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, crowning the top driver and team at season's end.</p>

        <h3>5. Pit Stops and Strategy</h3>
        <p>Drivers must make at least one pit stop to change tires, which is essential due to tire degradation and FIA rules on tire compounds. Teams use strategy to time pit stops, manage tire wear, and optimize fuel, often creating dramatic moments during races.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Tire Compounds</h3>
        <p>Teams must use at least two different compounds of tires during the main event. This is done to make sure strategies are varied throughout the race between teams. There are seven main compounds, of which three are used per race. There are also two different wet tires that are used when the need arises.</p>

        <h3>7. The Season and Championship</h3>
        <p>F1 runs from February to December, featuring around 20-24 races. The driver and team with the most points at the end of the season win the Drivers’ and Constructors’ Championships, respectively.</p>

        <h1>Iconic F1 Circuits and Moments</h1>

        <h2>Iconic F1 Circuits</h2>

        <h3>1. Monaco Grand Prix (Circuit de Monaco)</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Monaco Grand Prix, held on the narrow streets of Monte Carlo, is one of the oldest and most prestigious races in F1. The circuit is known for its tight turns, the famous tunnel, and the hairpin corner at Fairmont.</p>
        <p><strong>Memorable Moments:</strong> In 1984, a young Ayrton Senna amazed the world by finishing second in a rain-soaked race, signaling the arrival of a future legend. In 1996, only three cars finished in a dramatic, incident-filled race.</p>

        <h3>2. Silverstone Circuit (British Grand Prix)</h3>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Silverstone, the birthplace of F1, hosted the first-ever F1 World Championship race in 1950. It features famous high-speed corners like Maggots, Becketts, and Chapel, making it a favorite among drivers and fans.</p>

        <h2>Famous F1 Driving Techniques</h2>

        <h3>1. Trail Braking</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Trail braking is a technique where the driver brakes into the corner, gradually releasing pressure to shift the car’s weight forward, which helps in maneuvering tight corners with better grip and stability.</p>
        <p><strong>Iconic Moment:</strong> Ayrton Senna mastered trail braking, especially at street circuits like Monaco. His famous pole lap in the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix displayed impeccable use of trail braking, achieving an unprecedented gap over his rivals.</p>

        <h3>2. The Slipstream</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The slipstream technique involves a car following closely behind another to reduce air resistance, allowing the trailing car to accelerate and potentially overtake.</p>
        <p><strong>Iconic Moment:</strong> At the 2000 Belgian Grand Prix, Mika Häkkinen used Michael Schumacher’s slipstream on the Kemmel Straight to execute an unforgettable overtake. He used Ricardo Zonta’s lapped car as a blocker, creating a legendary three-wide pass to secure the lead.</p>

        <h3>3. The "Scandinavian Flick"</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Known primarily in rally, the "Scandinavian Flick" involves a quick flick of the steering wheel in the opposite direction before a turn, creating oversteer that allows the car to drift through a corner. It’s rarely used in F1 due to the grip-focused nature of the sport but has occasionally appeared on certain tracks.</p>
        <p><strong>Iconic Moment:</strong> During wet races, drivers like Kimi Räikkönen and Lewis Hamilton have used variations of this technique to navigate corners. Notably, Räikkönen’s control in the rain at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix showed the influence of this technique in adjusting his car’s balance through tricky sections.</p>

        <h3>4. Late Braking</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Late braking involves waiting until the last possible moment to apply the brakes before a corner, maximizing speed on the straight. It's a high-risk maneuver often used during overtaking attempts.</p>
        <p><strong>Iconic Moment:</strong> In the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton attempted an aggressive late-braking maneuver into Turn 1, overtaking multiple cars at once. Though he overshot, his bold approach showed how late braking can be used to gain positions in crowded moments.</p>

        <h3>5. Lift-and-Coast</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Lift-and-coast involves lifting off the throttle before braking to conserve fuel and manage brake temperature. This technique is often used in modern F1 for strategic reasons rather than pure performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Iconic Moment:</strong> In the 2015 Belgian Grand Prix, drivers were forced to employ lift-and-coast techniques due to fuel limitations. Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton expertly balanced pace and fuel economy, ultimately helping Mercedes secure a 1-2 finish.</p>

        <h2>Iconic F1 Moments Using These Techniques</h2>

        <h3>1. Ayrton Senna's Monaco Masterclass (1988) – Trail Braking</h3>
        <p>In the 1988 Monaco Grand Prix, Ayrton Senna’s trail braking helped him navigate the tight streets of Monaco with stunning speed, leading to one of the most dominant pole positions in F1 history. Senna’s precise control allowed him to push the car to its limits.</p>

        <h3>2. Mika Häkkinen's Pass on Michael Schumacher (2000 Belgian GP) – Slipstream</h3>
        <p>Mika Häkkinen’s use of the slipstream at Spa-Francorchamps to overtake Michael Schumacher is one of F1’s most iconic moments. The move, completed at over 300 km/h, demonstrated the perfect application of slipstreaming in one of the most memorable overtakes ever.</p>

        <h3>3. Lewis Hamilton in the Rain (2008 British GP) – Scandinavian Flick</h3>

        <h2>Why F1?</h2>
        <p>I was first introduced to Formula 1 by a friend in 2019. Initially, I didn’t think I would enjoy it, but he encouraged me to give it a shot. Ever since that first race, I’ve been hooked. The first race I watched was the Japanese Grand Prix, which took place near the end of the season. I watched every race remaining in the season and then went back to view a few famous older races. My favorite team is Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team, and my site’s colors are inspired by them. My favorite driver is Lewis Hamilton, who is set to join Ferrari next season.</p>
